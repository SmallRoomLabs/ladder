# Ladder - a text-based arcade game

### _Please note that this is a work still in progress..._

#### This is a reimplementation in golang of the classic 1982 CP/M game "Ladder" original written by Yahoo Software.


Ladder is a text based action game similar to Donkey Kong. You traverse through levels with platforms and ladders where barrels/rocks falls down from the top while you collect coins before reaching the exit.

There seems to be no source available of the original game, but back in 1999 Stephen Ostermiller made a version of [Ladder in Java](http://ostermiller.org/ladder/).

By running the original code in a CP/M emulator and peeking at Stephen's code I hope to be able to make something that plays like the original.
